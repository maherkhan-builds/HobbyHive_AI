## 🌟 Overview

**HobbyHive** is a visually rich, AI-powered micro-community discovery app that connects niche hobbyists using **geolocation intelligence + behavioral interest clustering**.

Instead of broad social feeds, HobbyHive surfaces **hyperlocal, emerging, and niche communities** — from rooftop gardening and urban beekeeping to indie board games and street photography walks.

It transforms discovery into **location-aware, AI-driven connection**.
